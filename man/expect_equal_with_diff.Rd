\arguments{
\item{current}{\code{[R object or expression]} Outcome or expression under scrutiny.}

\item{target}{\code{[R object or expression]} Expected outcome}

\item{tol}{\code{[numeric]} Test equality to machine rounding. Passed
to \code{\link[base]{all.equal} (tolerance)}}

\item{mode}{\code{[character]} Comparison mode passed to \code{diffPrint},
defaults to using the \dQuote{diffobj.mode} global option value with
\dQuote{unified} as fallback if no such option is set}

\item{format}{\code{[character]} Comparison mode passed to \code{diffPrint},
defaults to to using the \dQuote{diffobj.format} global option value with
\dQuote{ansi256} as fallback if no such option is set}

\item{...}{Passed to \code{all.equal}}
}
\value{
A \code{\link[tinytest]{tinytest}} object. A tinytest object is a
\code{logical} with attributes holding information about the
test that was run. The class attribute is set to \code{c("ttdo", "tinytest")}
to signal that it is a 'diffobj' result.
